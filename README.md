### In this project,
* I try to create an old style calculator,

* Capturing method was used for detecting which key was clicked,

* I've defined variables by using DOM querySelector etc. ,

* User can do substraction, addition, divison and multiply operations,

* I set some restrictions like user can not put operands next to each other etc,

* Also this is my first project with CSS grid.
